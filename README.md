This is a [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that relays in-game chat messages to & from a Discord channel, allowing for easy communication between players on a Minecraft server & members in a Discord server.

This mod depends on [my Events mod](https://github.com/viral32111/events) for mixin callbacks.
