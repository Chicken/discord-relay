> [!NOTE]  
> This is a fork of [viral32111's discord-relay mod](https://github.com/viral32111/discord-relay) tailored for my own needs.

This is a [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that relays in-game chat messages to and from a Discord channel,
allowing for easy communication between players on a Minecraft server and members in a Discord server.
