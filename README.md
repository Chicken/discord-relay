# Discord Relay

This is a Minecraft mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) that relays in-game chat messages between Minecraft and a Discord channel, allowing for easy communication between players currently on a Minecraft server and members in a Discord server.

This was previously a plugin for [Paper](https://papermc.io/), however development of that concluded but is still available on the [paper branch](https://github.com/viral32111/DiscordRelay/tree/paper).
